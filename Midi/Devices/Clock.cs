    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    ///     <para>
    ///         Clock is used for scheduling MIDI messages.  Though you can always send messages
    ///         synchronously with the various <see cref="OutputDevice" />.Send* methods, doing so
    ///         requires your code to be "ready" at the precise moment each message needs to
    ///         be sent.  In most cases, and especially in interactive programs, it's more convenient
    ///         to describe messages that <i>will</i> be sent at specified points in the future, and then
    ///         rely on a scheduler to make it happen.  Clock is such a scheduler.
    ///     </para>
    ///     <h3>Basic usage</h3>
    ///     <para>
    ///         In the simplest case, Clock can be used to schedule a sequence of messages which is
    ///         known in its entirety ahead of time.  For example, this code snippet schedules two notes to
    ///         play one after the other:
    ///     </para>
    ///     <code>
    /// Clock clock(120);  // beatsPerMinute=120
    /// OutputDevice outputDevice = ...;
    /// clock.Schedule(new NoteOnMessage(outputDevice, Channel.Channel1, Note.E4, 80, 0));
    /// clock.Schedule(new NoteOffMessage(outputDevice, Channel.Channel1, Note.E4, 80, 1));
    /// clock.Schedule(new NoteOnMessage(outputDevice, Channel.Channel1, Note.D4, 80, 1));
    /// clock.Schedule(new NoteOffMessage(outputDevice, Channel.Channel1, Note.D4, 80, 2));
    /// </code>
    ///     <para>
    ///         At this point, four messages have been scheduled, but they haven't been sent because
    ///         the clock has not started.  We can start the clock with <see cref="Start" />, pause it with
    ///         <see cref="Stop" />, and reset it with <see cref="Reset" />.  We can change the
    ///         beats-per-minute at any time, even as the sequence is playing.  And the playing happens
    ///         in a background thread, so your client code can focus on arranging the notes and controlling
    ///         the clock.
    ///     </para>
    ///     <para>
    ///         You can even schedule new notes as the clock is playing.  Generally you should
    ///         schedule messages for times in the future; scheduling a message with a time in the past
    ///         simply causes it to play immediately, which is probably not what you wanted.
    ///     </para>
    ///     <h3>NoteOnOffMessage and Self-Propagating Messages</h3>
    ///     <para>
    ///         In the above example, we wanted to play two notes but had to schedule four messages.
    ///         This case is so common that we provide a convenience class, <see cref="NoteOnOffMessage" />,
    ///         which encapsulates a Note On message and its corresponding Note Off message in a single
    ///         unit.  We could rewrite the above example as follows:
    ///     </para>
    ///     <code>
    /// Clock clock(120);  // beatsPerMinute=120
    /// OutputDevice outputDevice = ...;
    /// clock.Schedule(new NoteOnOffMessage(outputDevice, Channel.Channel1, Note.E4, 80, 0, 1));
    /// clock.Schedule(new NoteOnOffMessage(outputDevice, Channel.Channel1, Note.D4, 80, 1, 1));
    /// </code>
    ///     <para>
    ///         This works because each NoteOnOffMessage, when it is actually sent, does two things:
    ///         it sends the Note On message to the output device, and <i>also</i> schedules the
    ///         correponding Note Off message for the appropriate time in the future.  This is an example
    ///         of a <i>self-propagating message</i>: a message which, when triggered, schedules additional
    ///         events for the future.
    ///     </para>
    ///     <para>
    ///         You can design your own self-propagating messages by subclassing from
    ///         <see cref="Message" />.  For example, you could make a self-propagating MetronomeMessage
    ///         which keeps a steady beat by always scheduling the <i>next</i> MetronomeMessage when it
    ///         plays the current beat.  However, subclassing can be tedious, and it is usually preferable
    ///         to use <see cref="CallbackMessage" /> to call-out to your own code instead.
